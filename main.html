	<h1>Time Complexity and Space Complexity</h1>

	<p>Time complexity is a efficient factor in code analysis.The time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity </b>:Problem-solving using computer requires memory to hold temporary data or final result while the program is in execution. The amount of memory required by the algorithm to solve given problem is called space complexity of the algorithm.is O(n).</p>
